abstract="In modern recommendation systems, most methods often neglect the sequential relationship between items. So we propose a novel Sequence-based Recommendation model with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (BiLSTM4Rec) which can capture the sequential feature of items to predict what a user will choose next. By collecting consumed items of a user in a sequence with time ascending order, fitting the model with the last item as the label, the rest items as the features, we regard this recommendation assignment as a super multiple classification task. Once trained well, the output layer of our model will export the probabilities of the next items with given sequence. In the experiments, we compare our approach with several commonly used recommendation methods on a real-world dataset. Experimental results indicate that our sequence-based recommender can perform well for short-term interest prediction on a sparse, large dataset.",

abstract = "Traditional collaborative filtering techniques suffer from the data sparsity problem in practice. That is, only a small proportion of all items in the recommender system occur in a user's rated item list. However, in order to retrieve items meeting a user's interest, all possible candidate items should be investigated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a recommendation approach called DeepRec, based on feedforward deep neural network learning with item embedding and weighted loss function. Specifically, item embedding learns numerical vectors for item representation, and weighted loss function balances popularity and novelty of recommended items. Moreover, it introduces two strategies, i.e. sampling by random (Ran-Strategy) and sampling by distribution (Pro-Strategy), to leave one item as output and the remaining as input from each user's historically rated item list. Max-pooling and average-pooling are employed to combine individual item vectors to derive users’ input vectors for feedforward deep neural network learning. Experiments on the App dataset and the Last.fm dataset demonstrate that the proposed DeepRec approach is superior to state-of-the-art techniques in recommending Apps and songs in terms of accuracy and diversity as well as complexity."

  abstract   = {Text classification is a foundational task in many NLP applications. Traditional text classifiers often rely on many human-designed features, such as dictionaries, knowledge bases and special tree kernels. In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent convolutional neural network for text classification without human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to capture the key components in texts. We conduct experiments on four commonly used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, particularly on document-level datasets.},
